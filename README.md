# Gene_Regulatory_Network_Modeling
MATLAB source code for Jang et al. paper, "Dynamics  of  embryonic stem  cell differentiation inferred from single-cell transcriptomics show a series of transitions through discrete cell states."
We infer the network and plot it in cytoscape and obtain the predictions using the output files of the code GRN_code. It calls other functions.
